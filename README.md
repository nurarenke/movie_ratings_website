# The Eye

The Eye is the project of Nura Renke while a student at [Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/) in San Francisco, August 2017. I rebuilt it again after graduation.

# Overview & Features

The overall goal of the exercise is to build a website that allows users to rate films, and which predicts how they will rate films. This prediction is based on analysis of how other users rated that film, depending on how similar those other users are to the user. Lastly, The Eye, a system user with terrible taste in movies who will berate users for their movie ratings using machine language to decide how The Eye would rate things.

The data is from the MovieLens 100k dataset. Which is used to build correlations between users. The 
machine learning use for predictions is based on the concept of Pearson's correlations.

This is a screenshot of the Movie details page which shows the user's prediction, the average rating,
and what "the eye" predicted.
